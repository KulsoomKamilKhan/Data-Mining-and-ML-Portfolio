    "###### We’re interested in discovering hidden patterns between student performance and aspects of their personal life and social status that are usually overlooked. For this reason, we chose the Student Performance Data Set [1] from the UCI Machine Learning Repository - an open-source dataset that approaches student achievement in secondary education. It has 33 well-labelled fields of numeric, nominal and binary data types, so it is diverse enough for us to use a variety of different algorithms (especially various classification and regression algorithms). It also has a data dictionary to help us better understand the dataset and is complete with no missing fields, allowing us to make use of every data record. The data was collected using school reports and consented questionnaires. The data is anonymous - cannot be traced back to a particular individual. So, there are no ethical concerns regarding this dataset either.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### On the downside, the data is region based because it only includes data from 2 schools in Portugal. This could lead to more biased findings than if the data was taken from a more diverse demographic of students (in terms of location/nationality). Furthermore, the data set only has 649 instances. We would’ve preferred if there were more data instances for us to work with."
