# F21DL-Group-16  
DM &amp; ML Portfolio  

## For week-2  
- have comments in code  
- summaries- what we did, why we did, explain terms, equations, and methods  

missing values- none     
outliers- numerical (box plot) - Shreya  
preprocessing - changing column names, clean categorical attrb (finding the invalid ones and dealing with ones) - Kulsoom  
graphs- types for all attb (binary) - Areesha, Rida   
normalization- Richa  

## For week-3
- have comments in code   


change col name for grade to final_grade, discretization for g1, g2, g3  - Areesha  

correlation for g1, g3, final_grade (check the value for a strong correlation) (explain why g2 wasnt selected), take the top x ones - matrix or scikit learn method, heatmap, scattermatrix    

1 multi-class classifier on the 4 dataframes and accuracy for each dataframe - Rida  

report- meeting min, work div, contrib, this week's discretization - Areesha  
        correlation matrix- what, why, how (explain code), explain heatmap & scattermatrix, - Richa, Kulsoom, Shreya  
        working of the classifier, summarize results (best accuarcy, interesting inferences) - Rida    

optional task- Areesha (include in the report)  

Report- discretization of g1,g2,g3, what is correlation- why do we calculate it, (Areesha).   
what's a correlation matrix - why do we make one?, (Rida).   
 what's heatmap - why make one?, (Shreya).   
what's scatterplot - why make one, (Kulsoom).   
what's pairplot - why make one? (Richa).
